Smooth to uniform; a heuristic solution to the need to smooth a distribution with minimal reshuffling. Be careful, this version of the code is stuck in a step function (two levels), where the categories around the minimum and the categories around the maximum are reshuffled without eventually converging to a uniform distribution. Taking more neighbours into account would not solve the issue. A more nuanced version of the code should model the convergence more in accordance with the heat equation.
